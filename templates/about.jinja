          Code for Palestine was born in 2015 out of a desire to teach coding
          and entrepreneurial skills to some of the brightest high school
          students throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The organization 
          funding the initiative, the PalTel Group Foundation [PGF], recognized
          that there weren't enough students graduating from Palestinian 
          universities in STEM fields, and those that were graduating lacked 
          some of the critical skills needed to succeed in the private sector.
          Most importantly, PGF saw an opportunity for a tech-driven startup 
          scene to help tackle some of Palestine's problems, and realized that a 
          culture of entrepreneurship needed to be bred in order for a startup 
          culture to blossom.

          Code for Palestine is a three year-long program, beginning the summer 
          before 10th grade and concluding after 12th grade. Each year has many
          in-person sessions but is kicked off by a two-week camp held during 
          the summer. Volunteer undergraduate instructors from Stanford 
          University have served as the primary teachers during the two-week 
          summer camp.
